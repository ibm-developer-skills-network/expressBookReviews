In this project you will assume the role of a back-end developer working for an online retailer selling books. You have been tasked with developing a server-side application that stores, retrieves and manages book ratings and reviews.

Your server-side application is required to provide the following features and capabilities to allow users to:

Retrieve a list of all books available in the bookshop
Search for specific books and retrieve their details based on the book’s ISBN code, author names and titles
Retrieve reviews/comments for specified books
Register as a new user of the application
Login to the application
Add a new review for a book (logged in users only)
Modify a book review (logged in users can modify only their own reviews)
Delete a book review (logged in users can delete only their own reviews)
(Multiple users) Access the application at the same time to view and manage different book reviews simultaneously
