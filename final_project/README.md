# Final Project - Book Review Application

**Estimated Time Needed**: 2 hours

In this final project, we will build a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at the session level using JWT. You will then test your application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Create APIs and perform CRUD operations on an Express server using Session & JWT authentication.
- Use Async/Await or Promises with Axios in Node.js.
- Create REST API endpoints and test them using Postman.
